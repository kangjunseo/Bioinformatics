    "A graph whose nodes have all been labeled can be represented by an adjacency list, in which each row of the list contains the two node labels corresponding to a unique edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "A directed graph (or digraph) is a graph containing directed edges, each of which has an orientation. That is, a directed edge is represented by an arrow instead of a line segment; the starting and ending nodes of an edge form its tail and head, respectively. The directed edge with tail v and head w is represented by (v,w) (but not by (w,v)). A directed loop is a directed edge of the form (v,v).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a collection of strings and a positive integer k, the overlap graph for the strings is a directed graph Ok in which each string is represented by a node, and string s is connected to string t with a directed edge when there is a length k suffix of s that matches a length k prefix of t, as long as s≠t; we demand s≠t to prevent directed loops in the overlap graph (although directed cycles may be present).\n",

    "Given: A collection of DNA strings in FASTA format having total length at most 10 kbp.\n",

    "Return: The adjacency list corresponding to O3. You may return edges in any order."
